## Lasthop Music Stats

### Lasthop fetches music stats from your last.fm profile about your listening habits from this day in the years gone by.

Since the last.fm API doesn't support track history, this program scrapes users' Last.fm profile for track data.

##### To run:

```
$  musicstats
```

### Stats:
* Years on Last.fm
* Total number of tracks scrobbled
* Average daily scrobbles
* Most Played Artists on this day, for each year since joining Last.fm
* Songs played around this time of day, each year since joining Last.fm
* All artist play counts on this day, for each year since joining Last.fm
